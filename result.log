Title: Why are so many workers going on strike? – podcast
Description: <p>From posties to paramedics, the list of professions taking industrial action seems to keep growing. But will it lead to better working conditions – or just bring the UK to a standstill?</p><p>A wave of strikes are hitting the country this month. From hospitals to buses to the postal service, many of the country’s essential services will be disrupted. The impact of such wide-ranging industrial action is already being felt, but how much worse could things get?</p><p>The government says the state of the country’s finances makes meeting the demands of nurses and other public sector workers unrealistic, while unions say their members are facing real hardship.

Title: The Guardian view on proportional representation: Labour should back it | Editorial
Description: <p>House of Lords reform is necessary, but not a sufficient constitutional change to mend Britain’s broken politics</p><p>Monday marks the third anniversary of the general election that delivered the largest Conservative parliamentary majority since <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2019/12/13/boris-johnsons-brexit-campaign-wins-him-biggest-victory-since-thatcher-while-labour-suffers-night-of-historic-upsets/' title=''>Margaret Thatcher’s</a>. Labour, meanwhile, dropped to its worst result since the 1930s. Governments are thrown out when voters want a fresh start. What was unusual in 2019 was that voters gave the Tories the task of reversing Tory policies. That perhaps explains why Rishi Sunak heads a government that resembles an opposition in office, pitting itself against actions of its <a href='https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-set-allow-more-28670463' title=''>predecessors</a>.</p><p>This paradox highlights how close the two-party political system is to breaking point. People who voted Conservative at the last election know they have been had. Instead of getting a government that will fix the economy and the NHS, these voters have found themselves with ministers who are wrecking them. This has led to a widespread feeling of cynicism. Polling for the <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/08/win-as-one-campaign-target-tories-seats-tactical-voting' title=''>Compass thinktank</a> shows that even if Labour replaces the Conservatives at the next election, the majority of voters think the political system is incapable of meeting the big challenges of our time – such as climate, wealth inequality and housing.</p> <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/the-guardian-view-on-proportional-representation-labour-should-back-it'>Continue reading...</a>

Description: <p>Sunak’s gained a reputation for bending with the wind, it’s what won him the role. But that might not resonate with Tory voters</p><p>For any voters who have tuned into recent prime minister’s questions, Labour’s attack lines have been consistent and brutal.

Title: The Guardian view on cuts in theatre funding: a threat to playwriting | Editorial
Description: <p>In an industry drained of state support, who will dare to take a risk on new plays? The loss will be felt not only in London, but across the country</p><p>The storm over arts funding in England moved from opera to theatre this week, when the artistic director of one of London’s leading new writing houses <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/08/depriving-londons-theatres-of-funds-is-not-levelling-up-it-shortchanges-us-all' title=''>resigned in response</a> to the withdrawal of its Arts Council England grant. Its outgoing director, Roxana Silbert, said that the loss of its state subsidy of £766,455 a year meant it could no longer continue to function as a hub for new writing. Seventy-five playwrights turned out for a crisis meeting following the announcement, many of whom credit Hampstead theatre with giving them career-making breaks, and all of them worried about the effect on the fragile playwriting ecology of the country if a seedbed like Hampstead can only afford to stage guaranteed crowd-pleasers.</p><p>The 60-year-old north London venue is among 141 organisations cut adrift under Arts Council England’s radical three-year plan to reshape the creative economy of England. Called to account by the digital, culture, media and sport committee on Friday, the chief executive of the grant-giving government agency could only bat away a succession of local-interest criticisms from MPs with the statement that, of course, everything would be much better all round if only there was more money, but sadly there wasn’t – particularly in London, where it had been ordered to <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/23/areas-outside-london-set-to-receive-75m-to-level-up-access-to-arts' title=''>siphon £24m off to more needy areas</a> over the next three years.</p> <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/the-guardian-view-on-cuts-in-theatre-funding-a-threat-to-playwriting'>Continue reading...</a>
